    "The dataset is taken from the Cleveland, Ohio database. This dataset is a collaboration with physicians from Hungary, Switzerland, Virginia, and Ohio. It describes the age, sex, and other medical information about the patients that will give information on whether the patient might have heart disease or not. The data set has numerous attributes related to a full medical history of the patient. These attributes include various types of information related to heart disease like chest pain, years as a smoker, family history of heart disease and other related diseases, blood sugar levels, exercise levels, and anginas (chest pain due to reduced blood flow, symptom of coronary artery disease). The last attribute gives a diagnosis of heart disease for that patient, with a value of 0 being a <50% diameter of the vessel narrowing, or a value of 1 being a >50% diameter of the vessel narrowing. This attribute uses angiographys as a way to predict and diagnose heart disease. The values of this field range from 0 to 4 with 0 being no presence and 1-4 a range of presence. An angina is a very clear symptom of heart disease and has various types of anginas (as categorized by the data set with values 1, 2, 3, 4). A typical angina (value = 1) usually lasts for a few minutes and over the counter medicine can make it go away. An atypical angina (value = 2) can get worse over time and may indicate that the person is having a heart attack. A nonanginal pain (value = 3) usually results in pain similar to a normal angina however is due to different causes. Lastly, an asymptomatic angina is when there is an angina occurring, however usually little to no pain is experienced. \n",
    "\n",
    "The question we will try to answer is whether a patient will be diagnosed with heart disease. We have a number of predictors and we will use the technique of backward selection to narrow down our predictors to the few attributes that allow us to predict this most accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the Heart Disease Data set. This database describes 76 attributes but all experiments that have been published use only 14 as a reference. The `num` column describes the presence of heart disease in the patient. The `col_vessels` column indicates the number of major blood vessels colored by flouroscopy. The `slope` column indicates the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upslope, 2 = flat, 3 = downslope). The `st_depression` column indicates the ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest. The `ex_ang` column indicates whether the patient has exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no). The `max_hr` column describes inidcates a numerical value of the maximum heart rate achieved. The `rest_ecg` indicates the resting electrocardiac results (0 = normal, 1 = ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = probable/definite left ventricular hypertropy). The `fbs` column inidcates whether the patient has a fasting blood sugar of greater than 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false). The `chol` column describes the serum cholesterol level in mg/dl per patient. The `rest_bps` indicates the resting blood pressure (mm Hg). The `chest_pain` column describes the chest pain in the patient with varying types of anginas (1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = nonanginal pain, 4 = asymptomatic). The `sex` column indicates the gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female). The `defect` column refers to the defect of the heart (3 = normal, 6 = defect, 7 = reversible defect). Lastly, the `age` column indicates the age of the patient. "

    "Our model used the k-nearest neighbours algorithm with the data set of Cleveland heart disease patients to come up with an accuracy of 59% when determining the presence or lack thereof of heart disease (and the type of heart disease detected). Since the majority classifier in the data was 54%, our model improved on the majority classifier by 5%. If we look at the confusion matrix, our model is very good at determining cases where the patient had no heart disease. This was to be expected given the oversampling of cases in the data set where the patient had no heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to fix the accuracy of this model is to first determine whether a patient has heart disease or not. This could be determined by changing all the values of `num = 1, 2, 3, 4` to `num = 1`. Then, we can create a k-nn model which determines the boolean value of whether a patient has heart disease or not. If the model classifies that the patient does indeed have heart disease, then we could run those patients through another model trained on the original data (with all the `num = 0` cases filtered out). Therefore, our second model is only trained on heart disease cases and does not have the extra noise of the no heart disease case and will therefore predict with higher accuracy what severity of heart disease a patient has. \n",

    "These findings can be important to future studies or can be put to use at current medical institutions. However, we would need for this model to be a lot more accurate than 59% before we start seeing real life usage of it. We believe that firstly, more data needs to be collected. Somewhere in the level of `n = 1000-5000`. Then, we can possibly see a highly accurate models which could be used to quickly classify patients. If the model predicts any patients with `num = 3` or `num = 4`, we know then that there is a high possibility that this patient has severe heart disease and should be checked with promptly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Future questions and research directions could include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How can we improve the accuracy of the model further? Are there other machine learning algorithms or techniques that might yield better results with this dataset, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or deep learning?\n",
    "2. What additional features or predictors could be included in the analysis to improve the model's performance? Are there any other medical tests or patient characteristics that might be relevant in predicting heart disease?\n",
    "3. How does the model's performance change when trained on a larger, more diverse dataset? Would collecting data from a wider variety of sources or locations help improve the model's generalizability?\n",
    "4. How can we validate the model's performance in real-world settings? Can we set up clinical trials or partnerships with medical institutions to test the model's predictions against actual patient outcomes?\n",
    "5. What are the ethical implications of using data science algorithms in healthcare, particularly in the context of predicting heart disease? How can we ensure that the models do not perpetuate biases or lead to unfair treatment of patients?\n",
    "6. How can the model be integrated into existing healthcare workflows and systems? What changes might need to be made to the model or the way it is used to ensure that it can be effectively employed by medical professionals?\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these questions in future studies, we can continue to refine the predictive model and better understand its potential applications and limitations in the context of heart disease diagnosis and treatment."
